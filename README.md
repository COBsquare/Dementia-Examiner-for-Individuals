# Dementia-Examiner-for-Individuals
The project is in progress.

This project includes Mini-Mental State Examination test and clock-drawing test which are applied for seeking symptoms of dementia and its kind. Our application gives users to check their mental status by themselves without any assistance. Image processing and speech recognition are our main software components. Hand-drawn clock image and polygon shapes are evaluated by using image processing algorithms. Whole application supports the speech recognition to build interactions between the system and the users appropriately. This privilege makes the application available for both literate and illiterate users. Mini-Mental State Examination test should be applied without showing questions to the patients. Instead of that, questions should be read aloud. Application produces a report for the examination result.
